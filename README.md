# Orders App

This is a React project that uses JSON Server as a database server. It's a simple application that displays a list of items obtained through a JSON API.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 10 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikeychron/orders-test
```

2. Open a terminal in the project root folder and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the React project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start both the JSON Server and the React application. You can then access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/.

To run only the JSON Server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the JSON Server, which will run on port 3000. You can then use the API at http://localhost:3000/.
